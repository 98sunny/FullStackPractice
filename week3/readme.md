# Middlewares and Global catches
### Middleware
Middlewares basically does the checks which are needed to be done before any actions is taken.
The middleware in node. js is a function that will have all the access for requesting an object, responding to an object, and moving to the next middleware function in the application request-response cycle.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

- Execute any code.
- Make changes to the request and the response objects.
- End the request-response cycle.
- Call the next middleware function in the stack.
