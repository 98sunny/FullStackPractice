# DOM
## DOM- My understanding
- Document+Object+Model
- It helps us to see the whole HTML document as an Object and model it in JS using various functions.
- Basically, it helps us to refer and play around with various parts of an HTML elements using various functions and methods.

## Why do we even need DOM?
1. Most of the modern applications need changing the element on the website whenever the website is loaded/
2. Doing some operations at the backend and also displayong the outcome is where this is important.


## Difference between JS which runs on the browser and the JS specification.
Browser has some extra functionality as compared to the JS Specification.
For example: 
1. When we scroll down on LinkedIn/Instagram or on some social media, the rendeering of the new post happens depending on some feature(async feature) which is not provided by the JS Specification. Hoever, it is given in by the browser
2. Features like setTimeOut, http, fs are provided by NodeJS and not by JS Specification.
