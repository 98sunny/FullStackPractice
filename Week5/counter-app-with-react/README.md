## JSX
It is a JS filee in which we can write both JS and XML code.

## How does React work?
1. We see that we have a empty div element with id="root" in the index.html and in script we see a main.jsx has been referred.
2. The main.jsx will rendering a specific component in the empty div element.
3. In a simple react app, the rendered components is called App
4. We have this App component defined in the App.jsx


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
